# IPBES user documentation

## Getting Super Powers

This repository holds the public user documentation for IPBES IT services and tools which is hosted on [docs.ipbes.net](https://docs.ipbes.net)

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

## Tools

```
$ give me super-powers
```

Our documentation site is built using [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/), a Node.js static site generator especially focused on documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}
