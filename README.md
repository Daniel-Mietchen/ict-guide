### Markdown

Our documentation site is built using [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/). GitBook uses Markdown as its file format.

* All files should end in `.md`. They should be all-lower-case and match the title of the page, or in some cases an abridged version of it.
* All pages should start with a title, denoted with # (first level header).
* Subsections within a page are encouraged, and should use ## for a 2nd level and ### for a 3rd level. Do not have more than 3 levels of header.
* Inline code statements, file names, and keys that would appear in a file should use backticks like this `` ` ``.
* Always use inline links.
* Do not hard-wrap prose text. Set your text editor to soft wrapping.
* Internal links should be absolute (starting with `/`) and link to a file ending in `.md`, not `.html`. That makes them easier to find when needed to update.

### Language usage

* All documentation should be written in English.
