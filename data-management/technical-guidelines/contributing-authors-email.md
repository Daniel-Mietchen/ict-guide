## Contributing Authors Template Email considering ILK and the data and knowledge management policy

_This formal email could be sent after initial more informal contact is made, as appropriate._

Dear \[<mark style="color:red;">contributing author name</mark>],

It is my pleasure to invite you to be a Contributing Author for the assessment of \[<mark style="color:red;">assessment name</mark>], that is being developed by the [Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)](https://ipbes.net/). Specifically, you are invited to contribute to Chapter \[<mark style="color:red;">#</mark>] on \[<mark style="color:red;">Chapter title</mark>]. Your contribution would focus on the section on \[<mark style="color:red;">topic</mark>], and you would be working with \[<mark style="color:red;">IPBES authors names</mark>], who are \[<mark style="color:red;">Lead Author(s)/Coordinating Lead Author(s)</mark>] of the assessment and copied on this email.

The assessment of \[<mark style="color:red;">assessment name</mark>] was approved by the IPBES plenary in \[<mark style="color:red;">year</mark>] and will run until \[<mark style="color:red;">year</mark>]. It is being developed based on the attached scoping document.

As a contributing author, you would be linked directly to authors of the assessment and would be requested to provide specific contributions around themes, topics or geographic areas, as discussed with \[<mark style="color:red;">author name</mark>]. Contributing Authors do not however have access to drafts of the full chapter due to IPBES rules on confidentiality of assessment drafts.

Contributions by contributing authors are always highly valuable and gratefully received, and support the development of key themes in an assessment chapter. However, we cannot guarantee that contributions will be reproduced in their entirety in the assessment. They may be edited during rounds of drafting and external review processes so that they form a part of a coherent chapter. Also, depending on space and chapter structures, the chapter may eventually use a synthesised version of your contribution. However, your full contribution may be made publicly available in a data management report or in supplementary materials that are available online as companion resources to the assessment.

If you choose to share any previously unpublished indigenous and local knowledge or materials, you will be asked to confirm that you are authorised to share this information and confirm that it is non-confidential as specified in our guidance on documenting indigenous and local knowledge ([https://ict.ipbes.net/ipbes-ict-guide/data-management/technical-guidelines/ILK-considerations](https://ict.ipbes.net/ipbes-ict-guide/data-management/technical-guidelines/ILK-considerations)).

To enable open science and accessibility within IPBES, the Platform has a data and knowledge management policy available at [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3551078](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3551078).

Contributing authors are acknowledged on the first page of the Chapter to which they have contributed, but they are not listed as authors or within the citation of the chapter and assessment.

Finally, further communications guiding your contributions will be made directly by \[<mark style="color:red;">author name</mark>]. However, if you have any further questions feel free to contact me at \[<mark style="color:red;">email</mark>].

We thank you for considering this invitation to contribute to this assessment, and we look forward to your valuable input.

\[<mark style="color:red;">Signature</mark>]
