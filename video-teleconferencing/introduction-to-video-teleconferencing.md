# Introduction to video/teleconferencing

This guide provides a quick reference to virtual meeting tools being used and supported in UNEP. The features listed are not exhaustive but may be utilized as an initial checklist by staff to decide on which tool to use when planning a virtual event.

## Benefits of virtual event

1. Enhance participation
2. Save cost
3. Boost efficiency

## Types of virtual events

1. Conferences/workshops: inform, engage in discussions, exchange ideas, brainstorm. Format: presentations, facilitated discussion/brainstorming. Duration: often stretch over several days. Time zones: multiple.
2. Trainings: provide instructions and subject specific guidance, lead exercises. Format: mainly online presentations with little discussion, but may include exercises and other forms of participant engagement. Duration: typically not longer than half a day, although subject dependent. Time zones: multiple.
3. Meetings: Purpose: sharing information, engage in dialogue, working together on a deliverable. Format: conversation between two parties or more. Typically no visual aids necessary. May include group editing of a document/deliverable. Duration: up to a few hours. Time zones: typically 2.

2. Schedule event
3. Compile agenda
4. Decide on appropriate technology
5. Invite participants
6. Communication
7. Establish virtual event planning team

## General checklist before event

### A few weeks prior to event

Do a dry run: Set up a test event to confirm that all equipment is working. Have someone in another room log into the test event to test connectivity. Recommend that participants check with their local IT focal points to ensure there are appropriate software permissions. Share access details in event invitation and remind participants again closer to the event. Assign a facilitator to each presenter who takes care of all technical aspects.

### Immediately before event

Arrive at least 30 minutes early to set up computer, internet, projector etc. Ensure there is wifi access. Display “stand-by” slide before the event starts \(and during breaks\) so participants joining know they are in the right place. Limit background noise. For larger events, ask participants to mute their microphones when not speaking \(if necessary, get help from IT to mute participants\).

### Account for technical glitches

Ensure IT support is available during the event in case of any disruptions. Share a contact number/email of a staff in case a participant needs to report connectivity problems. This way, the flow of the event won’t be disrupted. Ensure the event facilitator has the contact details of each virtual participant \(or focal points for larger events\) so that they can be contacted in case there is some major disruption to the virtual event.
