{% file src="../.gitbook/assets/kudo-it-readiness_participant.pdf" %}
KUDO - IT Readiness
{% endfile %}

{% hint style="info" %}
An invitation to participate in a KUDO virtual meeting will be sent to you by the IPBES secretariat. The invitation will contain a link to enable you to connect to the virtual session as of 30 minutes prior to the communicated start time of the meeting. Please **do not share this link**: only participants invited by the secretariat will be authorized to participate in the virtual meeting. All excess or uninvited participants will be removed from the meeting by the meeting operators. Participants must be clearly identified by entering their country name or their organization name (for observers)
{% endhint %}

## Before joining **a KUDO meeting**

1. Please use either the **Goggle chrome or Firefox browser** to connect to the meeting.&#x20;
   * Allow browser to have access to camera and microphone. Avoid using ad-blockers
2. Connect your headset to your computer. Please avoid using the computer’s speakers: incoming and outgoing sound must be clearly separated to ensure optimal sound quality.&#x20;
3. Make sure you click on the KUDO invitation link from your webmail and not through a VPN connection from your respective administration or organization.
4. Use a **wired connection** (highly recommended)
   * If wired connection is not available, use high-speed Wi-Fi instead.(Ideally 20 and 5 Mbps, for download and upload respectively. 5Ghz / 802.11ac is highly recommended)&#x20;
5. Please make sure you have closed all applications on your machine, other than the browser used to connect to KUDO. Not only applications such as Skype still running in the background and blocking access to your computer’s microphone and webcam can be a problem. Even a page on one of your browsers left open for another video conference call with zoom, go-to, WebEx, MS Teams, .... can be a problem if you want to take the floor on KUDO as access to your computer’s microphone and webcam is still blocked by one of these pages. Even the KUDO test page of the first paragraph of this document and the previous point is blocking access to your webcam and should be closed before joining a KUDO session.
6. You can test how KUDO works ahead of a scheduled meeting by visiting [https://live.kudoway.com/test](https://live.kudoway.com/test)
