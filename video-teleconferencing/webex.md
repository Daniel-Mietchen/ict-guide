# Webex

## Introduction

Webex is the leading enterprise solution for video conferencing, online meetings, screen share and webinars. Webex meetings require a computer with internet access and a separate phone line. By logging into the meeting via the Internet, you will be able to see the presenter's computer screen.  By calling into the conference phone number, you will be able to hear the presenter and other participants. You can [join a test meeting](https://www.webex.com/test-meeting.html/) to familiarize yourself with webex.
