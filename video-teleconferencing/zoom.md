[![Firefox Zoom Install](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Firefox-Zoom-Install-300x170.jpg)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Firefox-Zoom-Install.jpg)

Google Chrome should automatically download the file and point to it as shown above. Clicking on the Zoom\_launcher.exe file will install ZOOM, there will be a short pause before a blue progress bar appears indicating the installation.

If an ‘Application Launcher’ or ‘External Protocol Request’ box appears simply tick the ‘_Remember my choice…_’ option box and then click ‘OK’

### Engagement

1. Encourage meeting participants to switch on their videos especially when they are speaking. The host can prompt a participant to start video sharing. [Disable video](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005759423?zcid=1231) to block unwanted, distracting, or inappropriate gestures on video.
2. Encourage participants to use the [Raise hand](https://app.gitbook.com/@ipbes/s/ipbes-ict-guide/~/drafts/-M4JP7X0qRJxDmcM1PrW/video-teleconferencing/zoom#raising-your-hand) feature when they want to make interventions

### Security

1. Do not share meeting ID on social media or on public sites
2. Ensure that each meeting has a password
3. Enable waiting room to check who is attending the meeting
4. Enable [meeting registration](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/211579443-Registration-for-Meetings)
5. [Remove unwanted or disruptive participants](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005759423-Managing-participants-in-a-meeting?zcid=1231). From that Participants menu, you can mouse over a participant’s name, and several options will appear, including **Remove** and **Put in Waiting Room**. Click **Remove** to kick someone out of the meeting. If this is not responding use the **Put in Waiting Room** option.

### Registration

Enable meeting registration. This will allow you to restrict participation to people who have registered for the meeting. [Find out more](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/211579443-Registration-for-Meetings)

{% hint style="warning" %}
You will not be able to export the list of participants if meeting registration is disabled
{% endhint %}

### Recordings

1. Consider setting up audio transcripts. The quality of the transcripts is fairly good and can ease the report writing work. The transcript will be exported in .vtt format which can be opened with a text editor like notepad. [Find out more](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004794983-Automatically-Transcribe-Cloud-Recordings-)
2. Consider enabling automatic recording if you are planning to record the meeting. Meeting hosts often forget to initiate the recording after the meeting has started.

### In meeting chat recording

You can save chats manually but there is a risk of forgetting to do this. It is recommended to enable auto-saving of chat messages which is off by default.

To enable in meeting chat recording see the guidelines under **Auto-saving chat** [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004792763-Saving-In-Meeting-Chat)

![Auto saving chat](../.gitbook/assets/autosavechat.jpg)

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you forget to enable autosaving chat or if you fail to manually download recording at the end of the meeting you will not be able to recover the chat history
{% endhint %}

### Meeting templates

Create and save meeting templates to ensure that you have all the required settings for each type of meeting. [Find out more](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360036559151-Meeting-templates)

### In meeting file transfer

2. Limit the types of files that participants can share.  See the hint below for the recommended file extensions
