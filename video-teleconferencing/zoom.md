1. Encourage meeting participants to switch on their videos especially when they are speaking. The host can prompt a participant to start video sharing. [Disable video](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005759423?zcid=1231) to block unwanted, distracting, or inappropriate gestures on video.
2. Encourage participants to use the [Raise hand](https://app.gitbook.com/@ipbes/s/ipbes-ict-guide/~/drafts/-M4JP7X0qRJxDmcM1PrW/video-teleconferencing/zoom#raising-your-hand) feature when they want to make interventions

### Security

1. Do not share meeting ID on social media or on public sites
2. Ensure that each meeting has a password
3. Enable waiting room to check who is attending the meeting
4. Enable [meeting registration](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/211579443-Registration-for-Meetings)
5. [Remove unwanted or disruptive participants](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115005759423-Managing-participants-in-a-meeting?zcid=1231).

Click **Remove** to kick someone out of the meeting. If this is not responding use the **Put in Waiting Room** option.

### Recordings

1. Consider setting up audio transcripts. The quality of the transcripts is fairly good and can ease the report writing work.
