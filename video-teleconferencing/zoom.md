If you are joining from a mobile device you will be prompted to download the Zoom Cloud Meetings app from the applications store. See [here](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/sections/200305413-Mobile) for more details

#### Joining from a computer: install required software

When entering a Zoom meeting for the first time from a computer you will need to download a small application file.mThis process is easy to complete on all commonly used browsers. See examples below:

**Mozilla Firefox**

Click ‘Save File’  and follow the instruction in the orange box.

[![Firefox Zoom Install](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Firefox-Zoom-Install-300x170.jpg)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Firefox-Zoom-Install.jpg)

Google Chrome should automatically download the file and point to it as shown above. Clicking on the Zoom\_launcher.exe file will install Zoom, there will be a short pause before a blue progress bar appears indicating the installation.

If an ‘Application Launcher’ or ‘External Protocol Request’ box appears simply tick the ‘_Remember my choice…_’ option box and then click ‘OK’

[![Zoom Application Launcher](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Zoom-Application-Launcher-300x228.png)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Zoom-Application-Launcher.png) [![Zoom External Protocol Request](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Zoom-External-Protocol-Request-284x300.png)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Zoom-External-Protocol-Request.png)

Just before entering the meeting you will be prompted to enter a display name. This name is simply to identify you in the meeting.Please enter both your given and family names.

#### Joining from a computer: audio settings

You will then be prompted how you wish to join your audio. If you wish to join audio via the telephone, follow the instructions further down, otherwise simply select Join Computer by Audio _\(TIP: by ticking the “Automatically join audio by computer…” option box first, will mean you won’t get prompted again in the future\)_

[![Join Audio by Computer](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Join-Audio-by-Computer-300x167.png)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Join-Audio-by-Computer.png)

#### Join via Telephone

If you are unable to join from Zoom on a computer or mobile device, then you can join on the telephone instead.

If you would like to attend a Zoom meeting via telephone within NZ please call the NZ number \(check this link for up to date numbers [https://zoom.us/zoomconference](https://zoom.us/zoomconference)\). Then enter the Meeting ID and PIN \(if required\) when prompted.

_Please note calls will be charged at standard national rates._

There are also many “local” dial-in numbers from many international locations. You can find more details on these [here](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/ways-to-join-or-host-a-meeting/phone/).

#### Join via Computer & Audio via Telephone

It is possible to use a combination of computer for video and phone for audio.

If you use this option, then enter by computer first and select the **Join By Phone** tab when the audio pop-up window appears \(see example below\). This will display the NZ dial in number for you \(or you can change it to display one of the many other countries which have a “local” dial in number by clicking on the flag icon\), as well as the Meeting ID to enter and your Participant ID.

Dial in as noted above, however after entering the Meeting ID, you will be prompted to enter your Participant ID. Simply enter this number followed by \# and your video and audio will then be synchronised.

[![Participants Icon](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Participants-Icon.jpg)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Participants-Icon.jpg)

If you wish to lower your hand, click the ‘Lower hand’ icon that will have replaced the ‘Raise hand’ icon.

You can use the ‘Chat’ facility to send text chat to all participants or privately to specific participants.

Click on the ‘Chat’ icon in the tool bar, again hover your mouse over the Zoom window if you can’t see the tool bar.

[![Chat Icon](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Chat-Icon.png)](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/zoom/files/2016/04/Chat-Icon.png)

It is recommended to mute your microphone when you are not speaking to reduce background noise and improve audio quality.

To do this simply click on the Mute icon at the bottom of the Zoom window.

#### Getting attention: Raise hand

At the bottom of the window on the right side of the screen, click the button labeled "Raise Hand." Click "Raise Hand" if you want to say something in the meeting.[![Screen Shot 2020 03 16 at 5.39.26 PM](https://i.insider.com/5e6ff268c485406c7f3d6aa2?width=700&format=jpeg&auto=webp)](https://i.insider.com/5e6ff268c485406c7f3d6aa2) 

Your digital hand is now raised. Lower it by clicking the same button, now labeled "Lower Hand."
