## Teams and Channels

_A team_ is a collection of people, conversations, files, and tools — all in one place. _A channel_ is a discussion in a team, dedicated to a department, project, or topic.

Channels are where the work actually gets done—where [text, audio, and video conversations](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/meetings-in-teams-e0b0ae21-53ee-4462-a50d-ca9b9e217b67) open to the whole team happen, where [files are shared](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/share-a-file-in-teams-0c4d34ee-5dd8-46d5-ab35-0d227b5e6eb5), and where [apps are added](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/add-an-app-to-teams-b2217706-f7ed-4e64-8e96-c413afd02f77).

### **Pick a team and channel**

1.  Select **Teams** ![Teams button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/20305b5c-df47-4154-a21a-b12712c4224c.png) on the left side of the app and then pick a team.

    If you're not on a team and want to create one.
2. Select a channel and explore the **Conversations**, **Files**, and other tabs.

### Create a team

5. Select **Create**.

   * You can add people, groups, or even entire contact groups.

7. When you're done adding members, select **Add** and then **Close**.

### Create channel for the team

By default, every team gets a **General** channel, which is a good channel to use for announcements and information the whole team needs. To add more channels:

3.  Enter a name and description for your channel.

## Collaborate on files in Microsoft Teams

### Your files library

Each channel has its own file folder where you can share files for that specific channel. To access that folder go to the channel and select the **Files** tab above the conversation window.![The files library lets you collaborate on files with your team](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/e7f0cb8f-46f7-4917-a652-cb4a7b92ca13.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Make sure to use the **Files** tab at the top of the channel conversation window instead of the **Files** button on the left side of the app. That button gives you access to ALL of your cloud files, rather than just the files for a specific channel.
{% endhint %}

In the library you can upload existing files or create new ones. When you upload a file, it creates a copy in Teams.

### Upload existing files

There are two primary ways to upload existing files into your library. Both methods start by going to the files folder for your channel and both methods, by default, upload copies of your files to the channel file folder.

* **Drag and drop** - Using your mouse, drag the file from where it's currently located and drop it on the Teams window among the files.&#x20;
* **Upload** - Select **Upload**, **** then select the file (or files) you'd like to upload, and select **Open**.

![Create or upload a new file to your channel's files library](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/950207d4-6fca-4c7e-91f9-6cae2575088f.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Any files you upload will be accessible by any member of your team. And just like in SharePoint, you can pin specific files to the top of your list for easy access.
{% endhint %}

### Create a file

To create a Word, PowerPoint, or Excel document in Teams, select **New**, then select the kind of file you'd like to create. The new file will open in Teams so you can begin editing it, and if you'd prefer to work in the desktop version of the app, select **Open in Desktop App** at the top of the app, in the middle of the ribbon.

As soon as it's created your new file will be available for your team members to edit as well.

### Co-edit a file

Files uploaded and shared to a team are accessible to every member of the Team. In Office for the web, Office for Android or iOS, or the latest applications from Office 365, you and your team members can co-edit Word, PowerPoint, or Excel documents, or comment on Visio files. No need to check files out or worry about if one of your colleagues has the document open. Just open the file you need to edit and if other team members are editing it to your changes will be seamlessly merged as you work.

### Share with people outside your team

If the file is a Word, Excel, PowerPoint or Visio file, the easiest way to share it is to open the file in its corresponding Office for the web or desktop app. Select **Share** at the top right corner of the window. From there enter the aliases or email addresses of people you want to email the file link, or select **Copy Link** to choose where you share the link.

![Share icon and dialog box in Excel](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/d442e1e0-ff37-4214-8352-e7c56decc3c8.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important:** To share with someone outside your team you'll have to open the file in Office for the web or Office desktop app.
{% endhint %}

If you want to share with people outside your organization you may have to select the permissions drop-down (right above where you add the people you want to share with) and select that **Specific People** can access the file.![Use the link settings dialog to specify permissions for a sharing link](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/5b10de12-a7ad-424c-b3ad-3c99d5890e4c.png)

## Sync SharePoint and Teams files with the OneDrive sync app

### Set up syncing

1. On the Microsoft 365 app launcher, select SharePoint or Teams, and then select the site with the files you want to sync.
2. &#x20;Select **Documents** or navigate to the subfolder you want to sync.
3. &#x20;Select **Sync**. (You only need to do this once on a computer to set up syncing on that computer. After you set up syncing, the files sync automatically.)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24) (1).png>)

4\. If your browser requests permission to use "Microsoft OneDrive," confirm that this is okay.

The files then sync to a folder on your PC that has the organization (United Nations). This folder is automatically added to the left pane in File Explorer. You can’t select to sync to a different location.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (36).png>)

### Change sync settings

Below are steps to follow to change the folders that sync for the site, or to stop syncing all files on the site:

1. Select the blue OneDrive cloud icon in the Windows taskbar notification area.

![cloud icon](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>)

{% hint style="warning" %}
(You may need to select the **Show hidden icons** arrow ![The Show hidden icons button.](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/81f646e6-c487-46b4-8c6b-c50e62ef23fd.png) next to the notification area for the **OneDrive** icon to appear. If the icon doesn't appear in the notification area, OneDrive might not be running. Select **Start.**, enter **OneDrive** in the search box, and then select **OneDrive** in the search results.)
{% endhint %}

2\.  Select **More** > **Settings**.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

3\.  To see a list of all your syncing sites, select the **Account** tab.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>)

4\.  To change the folders that you're syncing, select **Choose folders** for that library, and then select the folders that you want to sync. To stop syncing a site, select **Stop sync** next to the site. (Copies of the files remain on your computer. You can delete them if you want.)

## Chat

### Start Chat

You start one-on-one and group chats the same way: by selecting **New chat** ![New chat icon](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/50177cc7-a47b-41dd-b1a3-f0ba94ed9125.png) at the top of your chat list.

#### Start a one-on-one chat

Once you've selected **New chat** ![New chat icon in Teams](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/d7854e6f-cba6-4045-8820-2a07130394d0.png) and entered the person’s name, compose your message in the box at the bottom of the chat. To open your [formatting options](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/format-a-message-in-teams-9f7c64e4-0316-472f-b1e8-430cebcfc1e5), select **Format** ![Expand button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/39818b5e-d559-4213-968c-2f6ac0180f16.png) beneath the box where you type your message.

![Select Format to expand the box.](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/4061a793-312b-44be-8565-2d7f68baaf49.png)

When you're ready, select Send ![Send a message icon.](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/02edfc47-f927-48d8-bd7b-dc684e20e1f4.png) . This starts the chat.

You can also start a one-on-one chat from someone's profile card. Open it by clicking their picture in a channel or from a search.

#### Start and name a group chat

Start one the same way you start a one-on-one chat: select **New chat** ![New chat icon in Teams](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/97898dea-2d79-422f-ac6c-17f78f837f60.png) at the top of your chat list. Select the down arrow to the far right of the **To** field and type a name for the chat in the **Group name** field. Then, type the names of the people you’d like to add in the **To** field.

![Name a group chat in Teams.](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/2b1e7f6c-2d49-43ef-aa53-b2074c4fbb5d.png)

This starts a new conversation. Everyone who has access to the group chat can [send messages](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/send-and-read-messages-in-teams-b29e60ec-76af-4d97-8c3c-a4e36f2b64aa).

You can include up to 100 people in a group chat.

#### Add people to the conversation

To loop more people into the conversation, just click **Add people** ![Add people to team button](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/c84aa0b9-6f19-40ba-8e5d-53df1b072cb9.png) (or **View and add participants** in group chat) in the top right corner of Teams. Then, type the names of the people you'd like to chat with, select how much of the chat history to include, and click **Add**.

**Note:** When adding someone to a group chat (not a one-on-one), you can include the chat history.

![Chat history in Teams](https://support.content.office.net/en-us/media/2f0b0e65-1e64-4a9e-89cd-39e4f691ea2b.png)

Teams will save the whole chat history, all the way back to the first message. And if someone [leaves the group](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/leave-or-remove-someone-from-a-group-chat-7db55a67-0ba4-4409-a399-5ed502a1d094), their chat responses are still there in your chat history.

#### See who's in a group chat

To see who’s in a group chat, hover over the number of participants in the chat header to show a list of everyone’s names.
