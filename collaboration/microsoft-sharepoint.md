### **How to upload a file**&#x20;

You can upload files to a document library in SharePoint Online by just dragging them from your computer and dropping them into the document library. With most browsers, you can also upload folders and the files they contain.

* Open the document library where you want to upload a folder or files.
* On your computer, click **Start**, type file explorer, and then click **File Explorer**. Navigate to the folder or files that you want to upload.
* Select files or folders in **File Explorer** and drag and drop the folder or files onto the document library page. When you upload a folder to a document library, all files contained in the folder are automatically uploaded as well.
* You can also select **Upload** from the main document library menu, and then select **Files** or if your browser supports it, **Folder** from the menu.

If your browser doesn't support folders, when you click **Upload**, the **Choose File to Upload** page opens where you can select one or more files.

* Select the files or folder that you want to upload, and then click **Open** if you're uploading files or click **Select Folder** if you're uploading a folder.
