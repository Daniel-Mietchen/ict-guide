**Difference between Microsoft** **Teams and SharePoint**

Microsoft Teams is primarily a _chat-based workspace_ that enables real-time collaboration and communication among team members. It provides a platform for chat-based discussions, file sharing, video and audio conferencing, and integration with other Microsoft 365 apps.

While, SharePoint Online is a _web-based collaboration and document management platform_ that allows teams to create, share, and manage content such as files, documents, and lists. SharePoint provides a central location where teams can collaborate, store and organize content, manage workflows, and create custom applications.

While Teams and SharePoint Online can collaborate on projects and documents, they serve different purposes. **Teams** is ideal for real-time collaboration and communication, while **SharePoint Online** is better suited for document management and sharing. In fact, Teams provides a SharePoint site for each team to use as a shared file storage location.

In summary, Teams is a chat-based collaboration tool designed for real-time communication, while SharePoint Online is a document management and content collaboration platform designed for file storage and document sharing.
