# Joining Teams & Channel

## MEA IPBES - xx Teams & Channel

The secretariat has set up Microsoft Teams/SharePoint groups under the United Nations tenant and will invite experts to the channels relevant to their chapters and add all the experts.

### How to join the teams & channels

Here are the steps:

1. You will receive a Microsoft invitation from the United Nations (please note that if you have emailed me that you didn’t receive it, I’ve received your email). The email will be from “_GlobalAdmin Madik_”. Please accept that invitation within 24 hours.
2. You will then receive a second invitation to join the Teams & channel from Microsoft Teams. The message will read, "_Anne added you to the MEA IPBES Business and Biodiversity Assessment team_".
