# Joining MS Teams & Channels

## MEA IPBES - "_team name_" Teams & Channel

The secretariat has set up a Microsoft Teams/SharePoint collaboration workspace under the United Nations tenant and will invite experts to the different channels relevant to their chapters.

### How to join the teams & channels

Here are the steps:

1. Please provide a Microsoft Office 365 work or school email account to be invited as a user to Microsoft Teams. Send an email to the secretariat: [ipbes.registration@ipbes.net](mailto:ipbes.registration@ipbes.net).
2. You will receive a Microsoft invitation from the United Nations to access our applications. The email will be from “_uniteidentity\_noreply@un.org_”. Kindly accept that invitation within 24 hours.
3. You will then receive a second invitation to join the Teams & channel from Microsoft Teams. The message will read, "_Anne added you to the MEA IPBES "Assessment name" team_".
