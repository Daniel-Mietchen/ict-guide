## What is Google Groups?

It is a tool from Google that provides discussion groups for people sharing common interests through sharing a common email address. It can be used to invite members to a Google meet, set up chat rooms and share documents for collaboration.

You can use Google Groups to

1. &#x20;Send email to all group members with a single address
2. &#x20;Invite group members to a meeting and participate in discussions
3. &#x20;Share content with members, including documents, sites, videos, and calendars

* **Leave the group**—After you take this action, you can no longer access the group if it's not public.

Stop people from directly adding you to a group by following the instructions in [I'm in groups I didn't join](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/10566756).

### Unsubscribe or leave a group using Google Groups

You can stop getting email from a group by changing your settings or leaving the group.

1. Sign in to [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/).
2. Locate the group![and then](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/Th2Tx0uwPMOhsMPn7nRXMUo3vs6J0pto2DTn) choose an option:
   * To stay in the group but stop getting email, for **Subscription**, click the displayed option![and then](https://storage.googleapis.com/support-kms-prod/Th2Tx0uwPMOhsMPn7nRXMUo3vs6J0pto2DTn)select **No email**.

### Unsubscribe and leave a group using email

To leave a group and stop getting email from it, you can send an email to _group name_+unsubscribe@_group domain_. For example, to leave the group **mygroup@googlegroups.com**, you would send a message to **mygroup+unsubscribe@googlegroups.com**. You can send the request with no subject or body text.

### Troubleshoot leaving a group

If you’re signed in to a work or school account, you can't leave a group that your administrator set to include all members of your work or school.&#x20;

If you tried to unsubscribe and are still getting email, make sure:

* You unsubscribed using the same email address that gets the group email.
* The email is not being forwarded from an address that still belongs to the group. If they are, email the address and ask them to remove your address.
* You’re not signed up for the group with more than one email address. If you are, unsubscribe that email address as well.
* The group you left isn’t nested in another group. You will keep getting email from the second group, unless you leave it also.
* You’re on the desktop version of Google Groups. You can only leave a group from the desktop site.
