## What is Google Groups?

It is a tool from Google that provides discussion groups for people sharing common interests through sharing a common email address. It can be used to invite members to a Google meet, set up chat rooms and share documents for collaboration.

You can use Google Groups to

1. &#x20;Send email to all group members with a single address
2. &#x20;Invite group members to a meeting and participate in discussions
3. &#x20;Share content with members, including documents, sites, videos, and calendars
