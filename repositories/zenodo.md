Zenodo (https://zenodo.org/) is a general-purpose free and open-access repository operated by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) and funded by the European Union. It allows researchers in any subject area to deposit data sets, research software, reports, and any other research related digital artifacts.


A community to share publications related to assessments of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. The goal is to provide:

    open access to publications cited in publications or in combination with scientific names
    a digital object identifier (DOI) to enable citation of the publications including direct access to its digital representation.
    search functionality in CrossRef, DataCite, PubMed, RefBank, GNUB and Mendeley.

## Curation policy
Uploads (supporting material) must be material that has been prepared for Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), and may include dialogue reports, reports and proceedings of workshops commissioned or supported by IPBES, software or databases that facilitate the preparation or use of IPBES reports, policy-relevant tools and methodologies that facilitate the preparation or use of IPBES reports; Guidance materials that assist in the preparation of comprehensive and scientifically sound IPBES reports. Supporting materials are not accepted, approved or adopted by the IPBES Plenary.

# Community URLs

* Collection URL: links directly to your community collection.

# What does Zenodo provide/Why Zenodo?
* A persistent Digital Object identifier (DOI) is assigned for each upload to make it citable and trackable and findable. The assignment of the DOI is instantaneous when the researcher is submitting the file. Researcher can pre-assign
* Metadata of each record is sent to DataCite servers during DOI registration and indexed there.
* Data and metadata will be retained for the lifetime of the repository. This is currently the lifetime of the host laboratory CERN, which currently has an experimental programme defined for the next 20 years.
* Large file sizes of up to 50 GB
* Versioning of data
* Integration with GitHub
* All data and metadata uploaded is traceable to a registered Zenodo user.

#	What metadata is required by Zenodo
Metadata means ”data about data”. Metadata provide the context and information required to interpret and understand the data.
* Structural metadata: e.g. the file and directory structure, record trail of steps taken during collection and analysis, information about data formats.
* Administrative metadata: e.g. licences, access rights.
* Descriptive metadata: the context and information about the data, e.g. the name of dataset, research discipline, persistent identifier, the time and place of collection and publishing of the dataset, authorship and ownership, content description (keywords, variables, etc.).
